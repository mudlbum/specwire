faq:
  - q: "Which is better, QD-OLED or WOLED?"
    a: "The question has no general answer, and anyone giving you one is selling something. QD-OLED tends toward higher colour volume in bright highlights; WOLED tends to hold up better in a bright room because its black level does not rise as much under ambient light. If your desk faces a window, that single factor probably outweighs everything else. If you work in a controlled dim room, it barely matters and other attributes should decide."
  - q: "Why does text look slightly wrong on both?"
    a: "Because subpixel anti-aliasing assumes a horizontal red-green-blue stripe, and neither panel type has one. QD-OLED arranges RGB in a triangle; WOLED adds a white subpixel in a four-element layout. ClearType tunes for a layout that is not there. Later panel generations have reduced the effect — squarer QD-OLED subpixels, revised WOLED arrangements — but it is a hardware-layout issue and software cannot fully resolve it."
  - q: "Is burn-in still a real risk?"
    a: "It is a real mechanism that has been substantially mitigated rather than eliminated. Panels run pixel shifting, logo dimming and periodic compensation cycles, and manufacturers have grown confident enough to underwrite the risk — three-year burn-in warranties are now common across Dell, MSI and current ASUS models. Static high-contrast elements displayed for many hours a day remain the worst case. Read your specific model's warranty document rather than a general claim about the category."
  - q: "How do I find out which panel is in a specific monitor?"
    a: "Manufacturers do not always print it. TFTCentral maintains panel-database information, and panel makers announce generations with their specifications. Failing that, subpixel photography in independent reviews identifies the layout unambiguously. Be aware that a manufacturer can change panel supplier mid-production while keeping the model number."
  - q: "Does QD-OLED mean Samsung and WOLED mean LG?"
    a: "The panels do — Samsung Display produces QD-OLED, LG Display produces WOLED. The monitor brand is a separate question entirely. Companies including Dell, ASUS, MSI and Samsung's own monitor division ship QD-OLED panels, and companies including LG, ASUS and others ship WOLED. The badge on the bezel tells you very little about the panel inside it."
  - q: "Should I wait for RGB tandem OLED?"
    a: "That depends on whether you need a monitor now. RGB-stripe OLED addresses the text-rendering issue directly by using a conventional subpixel arrangement, and tandem structures raise sustained brightness — VESA cited tandem architectures as what made the True Black 1400 tier feasible. Waiting for display technology is an unbounded strategy, though; there is always a better panel eighteen months out."

QD-OLED and WOLED are two ways of getting coloured light out of an organic emissive layer, and the choice determines a short, specific list of behaviours: how black looks in a lit room, how text renders, how colour holds up at high luminance, and how the panel ages.

It determines nothing else. Tone mapping, port selection, firmware quality, warranty terms, panel coating, stand, and whether the unit that reaches you has a defect are all decided by whoever bought the panel and put it in a box. A great many buying arguments treat the panel type as though it settles the whole question. It settles about five things.

Here is which five.

## How each one actually makes light

**WOLED**, produced by LG Display, emits white light from the organic layer and filters it into colours. A fourth, unfiltered white subpixel sits alongside red, green and blue, contributing luminance without passing through a colour filter — which is why WOLED historically reached higher peak brightness on bright content, and also why highly saturated colour at high brightness has been the harder case for it.

**QD-OLED**, produced by Samsung Display, emits blue light and converts part of it to red and green using quantum dots. Conversion rather than filtration means less light is thrown away in the colour path, and the resulting primaries are narrow — hence the high colour volume that QD-OLED is known for, particularly in bright saturated highlights. The subpixels are arranged in a triangle rather than a stripe.

Everything below follows from those two paragraphs.

> [!KEY]
> WOLED filters white light and adds a white subpixel. QD-OLED converts blue light with quantum dots in a triangular RGB layout. Every real difference between them descends from that.

## The one that will actually affect you: black level in a lit room

QD-OLED's quantum-dot layer responds to light arriving from the front as well as light generated behind it. In a bright room, ambient light excites the layer, and the screen's black level rises — commonly described as a grey or purplish cast over dark content. WOLED, with a different anti-reflection approach, holds black better under the same conditions.

In a dim room this difference is close to irrelevant, and QD-OLED's colour advantage is free. In a room with a window behind you, it is the first thing you will notice and there is no setting that fixes it.

This single environmental factor probably decides more real purchases correctly than every other comparison in this article combined, and it is almost never on a spec sheet.

> [!WARNING]
> Every side-by-side comparison photograph you have seen of these panels was shot in someone else's lighting. Your room is the variable that matters, and it is the one the review cannot control for.

## Text, and why neither layout is what your software expects

Subpixel anti-aliasing — ClearType on Windows — assumes pixels are laid out as a horizontal red-green-blue stripe. It positions colour fringes deliberately to make glyph edges appear smoother at a resolution the display could not otherwise achieve.

Neither OLED layout is that stripe. QD-OLED's triangular arrangement and WOLED's four-subpixel arrangement both cause ClearType's assumptions to break, producing colour fringing around high-contrast text. The two fail differently: QD-OLED tends to show a fine colour edge, WOLED more of a displacement or uneven weight.

Newer generations have narrowed this. Later QD-OLED panels use squarer subpixels, and revised WOLED arrangements reduce the effect relative to the earlier RWBG layout. RGB-stripe OLED panels solve it outright by simply having the layout the software expects.

Two practical mitigations, neither complete: higher pixel density makes the fringe smaller than the eye resolves at normal viewing distance, and turning ClearType off trades fringing for softer text — some people prefer that trade and most do not.

> [!TIP]
> If you write code or read documents for eight hours a day, weight text rendering heavily and view a unit in person before committing. If you mostly game and watch video, this section barely matters.

## Burn-in, and what the warranties now say

Both technologies use organic emitters that age with use, and uneven use produces uneven ageing. That mechanism has not been repealed. What has changed is the mitigation and the commercial confidence around it.

Panels now ship with pixel shifting, logo dimming, brightness limiting on static elements, and compensation cycles that run after a set number of hours. Manufacturers have followed with warranties that name burn-in explicitly:

| Brand | Burn-in coverage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dell / Alienware | 3 years | Applies across Dell's OLED monitor range |
| MSI | 3 years | Announced for its OLED monitors |
| ASUS | 3 years on current models | Some earlier models carry 2 years |
| LG UltraGear | 2 years | Introduced in the US in 2023 |

Coverage varies by model, region, purchase date and retailer, and a warranty is a document rather than a headline. Read the one attached to the specific unit you are buying.

The behavioural advice has not changed: vary content, hide static taskbars and HUD elements where you can, do not leave a static image on screen for hours at maximum brightness, and let the compensation cycle run instead of pulling the plug the moment you finish.

## What the panel does not decide

This is the part most comparisons skip, and it is where most of the difference between two monitors on a shelf actually comes from.

- **Tone mapping.** How the display handles content mastered brighter than it can show. Entirely the brand's firmware, and the largest single factor in whether HDR looks right.
- **Peak and sustained brightness as delivered.** Panel capability sets a ceiling; the brand's power delivery, thermal design and luminance limiter decide what you get. Check the [DisplayHDR True Black tier](/displays/displayhdr-tiers-explained/), which is measured on the finished product.
- **Ports and bandwidth.** Whether you get DisplayPort 2.1, how many HDMI 2.1 ports, whether DSC engages.
- **Coating.** Matte, semi-gloss or glossy changes the ambient-light behaviour discussed above more than the panel type does in some rooms.
- **Motion handling and overdrive tuning.** See [why the response time on the box isn't what you think](/displays/monitor-response-time-1ms-explained/).
- **Which brightness figure the maker chose to print.** A peak number and a sustained number are both honest and wildly different; see [what nits and cd/m² actually measure](/explainers/nits-cd-m2-lumens-explained/).
- **Quality control.** Uniformity and defect rates vary between brands using identical panels.

> [!NOTE]
> Two monitors with the same Samsung Display QD-OLED panel, bought the same week, can differ in HDR behaviour, port selection, warranty length and text appearance. Panel type is the first filter, not the decision.

## How to find out which panel is in a given monitor

Manufacturers frequently do not say. Three approaches, in order of reliability:

1. **Panel databases.** TFTCentral tracks panel generations and the products using them.
2. **Subpixel photography in independent reviews.** The layout is unambiguous under magnification, and reviewers routinely publish it.
3. **Panel-maker announcements.** Samsung Display and LG Display publish generation specifications; matching size, resolution and refresh rate usually identifies the part.

Be aware that a manufacturer can change panel supplier during a production run without changing the model number. This is the "panel lottery" people complain about, it is real, and it is why a review of a unit from launch week may not describe the unit you receive.

> [!ACTION]
> A workable order of decisions:
> 1. Assess your room's lighting honestly. Bright room → weight WOLED, or a matte QD-OLED, or reconsider OLED entirely.
> 2. Weigh text work against media and gaming. Heavy text → check subpixel layout and pixel density first.
> 3. Verify the [DisplayHDR True Black tier](https://displayhdr.org/certified-products/) rather than trusting "OLED" as a brightness claim.
> 4. Read the actual burn-in warranty document for your model and region.
> 5. Buy from somewhere with a real return window, because panel variation is not something any review can rule out for your unit.

## The summary worth keeping

QD-OLED converts, WOLED filters. That gives QD-OLED an edge in colour volume at brightness and gives WOLED an edge in a lit room. Both fringe text, differently, and both are improving. Burn-in is a managed risk that manufacturers now underwrite for two to three years.

Beyond that, you are choosing between products, not technologies — and the product-level differences are larger than the panel-level ones more often than the internet suggests.
